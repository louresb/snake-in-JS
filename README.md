# Snake Game in Javascript 🐍

In this project I recreated the classic Snake game.
Learned important concepts like push, pop, setInterval, clearInterval and eventListener. I used my prior knowledge to spruce up the page a bit and showcase my Spanish.

### Changes:

* I developed the page in Spanish
* Added user instructions


## 🚀 Let's code! 🚀
