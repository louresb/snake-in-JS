# Snake Game in Javascript 🐍

In this project I recreated the classic Snake game.
Learned important concepts like push, pop, setInterval, clearInterval and eventListener. I used my prior knowledge to spruce up the page a bit and showcase my Spanish.

### Changes:

* Webpage in spanish
* Added user instructions
* Added js code to avoid a invisible line bug as other devs had noticed and made a pull request to the main


## 🚀 Let's code! 🚀
